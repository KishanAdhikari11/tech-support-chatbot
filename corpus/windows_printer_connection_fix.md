# Fix Printer Connection and Printing Problems in Windows After Updates

## Problem Description
Post-Windows update, printers may fail to connect, spooler crashes occur, or jobs queue indefinitely. Common after cumulative updates affecting drivers or services.

**Symptoms:**
- Printer offline or not found.
- Print jobs stuck in queue.
- Spooler service errors post-reboot.
- Random text printing on USB printers.

## Possible Causes
- Outdated/incompatible drivers after update.
- Corrupted spooler cache.
- Network/wireless disconnects.
- Point & Print restrictions from security updates (e.g., KB5005565).

## Ground Truth Resolution Steps
1. **Power Cycle and Basic Checks:**
   - Turn off printer, unplug for 30s, reconnect and power on.
   - For wired: Verify USB cable; run USB troubleshooter.
   - For wireless: Confirm same network; run printer's wireless test.

2. **Run Built-in Troubleshooter:**
   - Settings > System > Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters > Printer > Run.
   - Restart PC and test print.

3. **Remove and Reinstall Printer:**
   - Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Printers & scanners > Select printer > Remove.
   - Add back: Click Add device; if manual, select port and update drivers via Windows Update or manufacturer site.

4. **Update Drivers:**
   - Device Manager > Printers > Right-click > Update driver > Search automatically.
   - If fails: Download latest from manufacturer (match Windows version, 64-bit).
   - Uninstall old: Right-click > Uninstall device; restart.

5. **Spooler-Specific Fixes (Post-Update):**
   - Services.msc > Print Spooler > Restart service; set Startup to Automatic.
   - Clear cache: Stop Spooler > Delete files in C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS > Restart service.

## References
- Manufacturer driver downloads.
- Expected Outcome: Printer responsive; test page prints successfully.
