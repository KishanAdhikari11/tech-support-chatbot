# Cisco AnyConnect Authentication Failures FAQ and Troubleshooting

## Problem Description
Authentication failures in AnyConnect prevent VPN tunnel establishment, often due to credential, certificate, or server issues. Common in remote work scenarios with MFA or certificate-based auth.

**Symptoms:**
- "Authentication failed" or "Login failed" message post-credential entry.
- Stuck at "Authenticating..." screen.
- Intermittent failures after network changes.

## Possible Causes
- Incorrect username/password or group selection.
- Inactive/locked user account.
- Authentication server (RADIUS, LDAP) unreachable or misconfigured.
- Certificate expiration or mismatch.
- Firewall blocking VPN traffic (UDP 443/UDP 4443).

## Ground Truth Resolution Steps
1. **Basic Checks:**
   - Verify username, password, and domain/group are correct.
   - Ensure user account is active and unlocked.

2. **Client-Side Fixes:**
   - Restart AnyConnect client.
   - Clear cached credentials: In AnyConnect preferences, disable "Allow local LAN access" temporarily and reconnect.
   - Update AnyConnect to latest version via admin portal.

3. **Log Collection and Analysis:**
   - Enable verbose logging: In AnyConnect, go to Settings > Preferences > Logging > Enable Debug.
   - Reproduce issue and export logs (vpnagent.log).
   - Look for errors: "EAP failure," "AAA denied," or "Server unreachable."

4. **Server-Side Verification (IT Admin):**
   - Test connectivity: Ping authentication server from VPN headend.
   - Review ASA logs: `show logging | include auth`.
   - Reissue certificates if using PKI.
   - Ensure DTLS is enabled if TLS fallback fails: Config > Remote Access VPN > AnyConnect Profiles > Enable DTLS.

5. **Advanced:**
   - If SAML/SSO involved: Clear browser cache and test in incognito.
   - Contact Cisco TAC with logs if persists.
